Based on the idea of motion decoupling, we designed a novel MAFRS system which is consists of an external driving device and a motor-free insertable wireless robotic device with a hollow flexible joint. Due to the problems of abdominal wall obstruction and variability in abdominal wall thickness during the actual application of the MAFRS system, as well as the existence of multiple permanent magnets and magnetically conductive media, high- precision position and attitude control of the insertable device without onboard motors has always been a challenge. We use the external driving device to generate a magnetic field to control the position and attitude of the internal robotic device. Aiming at the automatic precise tilt motion control of the novel MAFRS camera system, we have developed a closed-loop control scheme using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. By referring to the damping characteristics of human muscles, a virtual-muscle method is proposed to eliminate the chattering problem of the MAFRS camera at specific angles. The experimental investigations indicate that the internal robotic device can be effectively controlled under different abdominal wall thicknesses. The tilt motion control accuracy is within 0.5Â°, and it has good adaptability and antiinterference performance.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560927","Nature; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560927","","Motion planning;Wireless communication;Minimally invasive surgery;Attitude control;Magnetomechanical effects;Robot vision systems;Reinforcement learning","attitude control;closed loop systems;damping;medical robotics;motion control;muscle;position control;surgery","flexible-joint robotic camera system;single incision laparoscopic surgery;novel Magnetic Actuated Flexible-joint Robotic Surgical;4-DOF;motion decoupling;MAFRS system;external driving device;motor-free insertable wireless robotic device;hollow flexible joint;abdominal wall obstruction;abdominal wall thickness;multiple permanent magnets;magnetically conductive media;high- precision position;attitude control;insertable device;onboard motors;magnetic field;internal robotic device;automatic precise tilt motion control;MAFRS camera system;closed-loop control scheme;Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm;different abdominal wall thicknesses;motion control accuracy","","","","17","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obvious enticement is that the robot should be able to improve its own behavior without the need for detailed step-by-step programming. However, for RL to reach its full potential, the algorithms must be sample efficient: they must learn competent behavior from very few real-world trials. From this perspective, model-based methods, which use experiential data more efficiently than model-free approaches, are appealing. But they often require exhaustive exploration to learn an accurate model of the domain. In this paper, we present an algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Decision Trees (RL-DT), that uses decision trees to learn the model by generalizing the relative effect of actions across states. The agent explores the environment until it believes it has a reasonable policy. The combination of the learning approach with the targeted exploration policy enables fast learning of the model. We compare RL-DT against standard model-free and model-based learning methods, and demonstrate its effectiveness on an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot scoring goals in a penalty kick scenario.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509181","","Humanoid robots;Decision trees;Machine learning;Learning systems;Robotics and automation;USA Councils;Computer science;Decision making;Robot programming;Helicopters","decision making;decision trees;generalisation (artificial intelligence);humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems","generalized model learning;reinforcement learning;autonomous robot;decision making;robot programming;decision trees;Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot","","51","2","14","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a detailed and realistic dynamic model of the entire system is derived. A multi-layer reinforcement learning neural network control architecture is designed next to regulate the interaction force during positioning. To regulate the interaction force, the neural network measures the interaction force and proposes a modification to the a priori prescribed formation constrained position trajectory.

However, abundant information in self-supervised auxiliary tasks has been disregarded, since the representation learning part and the decision-making part are separated. To sufficiently utilize information in auxiliary tasks, we present a simple yet effective idea to employ self-supervised loss as an intrinsic reward, called Intrinsically Motivated Self-Supervised learning in Reinforcement learning (IM-SSR). We formally show that the self-supervised loss can be decomposed as exploration for novel states and robustness improvement from nuisance elimination. IM-SSR can be effortlessly plugged into any reinforcement learning with self-supervised auxiliary objectives with nearly no additional cost.

To achieve this objective requires that the machines have the ability to adapt autonomously to complex and changing environments. Recent developments in automation have focused on the application of different machine learning approaches, of which the use of reinforcement learning algorithms is considered the most promising. The key advantage of reinforcement learning is the ability of the system to learn, adapt and work independently in a dynamic environment. This article investigates an application of reinforcement learning algorithm for heavy mining machinery automation. To this end, the training associated with reinforcement learning is done using the multibody approach. The procedure used combines a multibody approach and proximal policy optimization with a covariance matrix adaptation learning algorithm to simulate an autonomous excavator. The multibody model includes a representation of the hydraulic system, multiple sensors observing the state of the excavator and deformable ground.

In day-ahead (DA) energy markets, strategies such as uniform price, discriminatory, and second-price uniform auctions result in different price settlements and thus offer different levels of market power. In this paper, we present a nonzero sum stochastic game theoretic model and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution framework that allow assessment of market power in DA markets. Since there are no available methods to obtain exact analytical solutions of stochastic games, an RL-based approach is utilized, which offers a computationally viable tool to obtain approximate solutions. These solutions provide effective bidding strategies for the DA market participants. The market powers associated with the bidding strategies are calculated using well-known indexes like Herfindahl-Hirschmann index and Lerner index and two new indices, quantity modulated price index (QMPI) and revenue-based market power index (RMPI), which are developed in this paper.

Since this framework is similar to the memory reconstruction process in psychology, we name the newly proposed RL framework as Graph-Based Memory Reconstruction (GBMR). In particular, GBMR first maintains an attribute graph on the agent's memory and then retrieves its critical nodes to build and update potential paths among these nodes. This novel pipeline drives the RL agent to learn faster with its memory-enhanced value functions and reduces interactions with the environment by reconstructing its valuable paths. Extensive experimental analyses and evaluations in the Grid Maze and some challenging Atari environments demonstrate GBMR's superiority over traditional RL methods.

However, contemporary driving automation applications based on expert systems or prede-fined control strategies are not in line with individual human driver's preference. To overcome this problem, we propose a Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control (P-ACC) system that can learn the driver's car-following preferences from historical data using model-based maximum entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Once activated in real-time, the P-ACC system first classifies the driver type and the weather type (at that moment). The vehicle is then controlled using the pre-trained IRL model on the cloud of the associated class. The personalized IRL model on the cloud will be updated as more human driving data is collected from various scenarios. Numerical simulation with real-world naturalistic driving data shows that, the accuracy of reproducing the real-world driving profile improves up to 30.1% in terms of speed and 36.5% in terms of distance gap, when P-ACC is compared with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Game engine-based human-in-the-loop simulation demonstrates that, the takeover frequency of the driver during the usage of P-ACC decreases up to 93.4%, compared with that during the usage of IDM-based ACC.","","978-1-7281-9681-7","10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9812446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812446","","Automation;Clouds;Reinforcement learning;Numerical simulation;Data models;Real-time systems;Numerical models","adaptive control;automobiles;behavioural sciences;driver information systems;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles","P-ACC system;driver type;weather type;pre-trained IRL model;personalized IRL model;human driving data;real-world naturalistic driving data shows;real-world driving profile;Intelligent Driver Model;game engine-based human-in-the-loop simulation;IDM-based ACC;Personalized car;autonomous driving;Inverse Reinforcement Learning;human driving maneuvers;lane keeping;contemporary driving automation applications;expert systems;prede-fined control strategies;individual human driver;Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control system;historical data;model-based maximum entropy Inverse Reinforcement","","10","","28","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet simulators are mostly considered as black boxes while we have the knowledge to make them produce a richer information. In this paper, we are proposing to use the derivatives of the simulator to help with the convergence of the learning. For that, we combine model-based trajectory optimization to produce informative trials using 1st- and 2nd-order simulation derivatives. These locally-optimal runs give fair estimates of the value function and its derivatives, that we use to accelerate the convergence of the critics using Sobolev learning. We empirically demonstrate that the algorithm leads to a faster and more accurate estimation of the value function. The resulting value estimate is used in model-predictive controller as a proxy for shortening the preview horizon.

Besides, proper disassembly sequence planning helps to improve the disassembly efficiency. In this paper, the framework of robotic disassembly sequence planning using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to solve robotic disassembly sequence planning (RDSP) problem. Considering the smoothness of starting and stopping in robotic movement, dynamic moving speed model is built for moving time in disassembly. Firstly, a disassembly precedence matrix (DPM) is constructed according to the structure of disassembly products. After that, RDSP is modeled as Markov decision process and the state, action and reward of the agent in DRL environment are designed. The deep reinforcement learning network model is trained to obtain the optimal disassembly sequence in RDSP.

SAC is an off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that considers entropy regularization during action selection. This mechanism accelerates the training process of the agent and prevents premature convergence to a local optimum solution.

Neural networks and traditional reinforcement learning have been applied to control and optimize batch processes. However, they usually lack robustness and accuracy leading to unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a stochastic multi-step action Q-learning algorithm (SMSA) based on multiple step action Q-learning (MSA). In MSA, the action space is divided into some same time steps, which means that some non-optimal actions will be continuously and compulsively applied in a long time and the speed of learning might be slow. Compared with MSA, the modification of SMSA is that several time steps are different and a modified greedy algorithm is used to improve the speed, efficiency and flexibility of algorithm. The proposed method is applied to a simulated fed-batch process and it gives better optimization control performance than other control strategies.","","978-1-7281-2767-5","10.1109/CCTA.2019.8920472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920472","Batch process;optimal control;reinforcement learning","Learning (artificial intelligence);Batch production systems;Process control;Optimization;Neural networks;Mathematical model;Inductors","agile manufacturing;batch processing (industrial);greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;optimal control;stochastic processes","stochastic multistep action Q-learning algorithm;modified greedy algorithm;fed-batch process;optimization control performance;reinforcement learning algorithm;agile manufacturing;high value added products;neural networks;nonlinear characteristics;optimal control","","2","","19","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper extends and demonstrates the QRL to quantum multi-agent RL (QMARL). However, the extension of QRL to QMARL is not straightforward due to the challenge of the noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) and the non-stationary properties in classical multi-agent RL (MARL). Therefore, this paper proposes the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) QMARL framework by designing novel VQCs for the framework to cope with these issues.

As a key link in the FPGA EDA design flow, the significance of placement technology for FPGA is self-evident. Simulated annealing is widely used in FPGA placement as an independent algorithm or an enhancement step of analytical placement algorithms. However, as the inherent properties of circuit cannot be utilized by the traditional simulated annealing algorithm, it depends on tremendous random swap operations, which is very time-consuming, making it cannot keep up with the increasing design scale and FPGA chip resources. In this paper, we propose an improving simulated annealing placer based on reinforcement learning. Many types of search region construction methods are proposed in which the placer can explore the solution space more efficiently, and thus can avoid exploring the redundant design space. Then, an intelligent strategy for selecting the most powerful search regions based on reinforcement learning is investigated to further ameliorate the applicability of the placer.

In most traffic scenarios, such as merging scenarios, the interactions between vehicles are a game process. Therefore, a critical factor is to accurately simulate the game and interaction processes between the background vehicle (BV) and AV in the test environment. With the increasing availability of natural driving data, a data-driven approach can be introduced to identify the underlying driving behavior patterns in actual driving data. Thus, this paper proposes a data-driven method for modeling BV behavior for AV testing in virtual scenarios. The method describes the vehicle decision process in the merging scenario as a standard Markov decision process (MDP). Based on game theory, we considered the BV as a game subject to illustrate the vehicle interaction process. Furthermore, a deep maximum entropy-inverse reinforcement learning combined with the game matrix is proposed to identify the reward function that describes BV behavior. The obtained reward function is used to design a deep Q-network algorithm to simulate the behavior of BV. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with natural driving data. Moreover, we performed comparative tests with the other two baseline methods; the results show that the proposed method can accurately simulate the interaction behaviors between vehicles in the virtual scenarios.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2023.3323138","Major Project of Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Development Special Project(grant numbers:CSTB2022TIAD-STX0003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0183); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274818","data-driven;deep reinforcement learning;game theory;inverse reinforcement learning","Games;Behavioral sciences;Merging;Reinforcement learning;Testing;Vehicle dynamics;Roads","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Efficient resource allocation in XR is crucial for delivering a seamless and smooth user experience. However, existing research on resource allocation for XR applications does not consider the interaction between XR content and users. In this paper, we propose a deep Q network(DQN) approach to minimize service latency in XR applications. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process(MDP) and apply DQN as the solution.

Because of the mobility of mobile equipments (MEs), if MEs move among the reach of the small cell networks (SCNs), the offloaded tasks cannot be returned to MEs successfully. As a result, migration incurs additional costs. In this paper, joint task offloading and migration schemes in mobility-aware Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) network based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) are proposed to obtain the maximum system revenue. Firstly, the joint optimization problems of maximizing the total revenue of MEs are put forward, in view of the mobility-aware MEs. Secondly, considering time-varying computation tasks and resource conditions, the mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem is described as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to work out the problem, instead traditional methods. Finally, it is shown that the proposed schemes can obviously raise the total revenue of MEs by giving simulation results.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2020.08.003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190128","MEC;computation offloading;mobility-aware;migration scheme;Markov decision process;reinforcement learning","Task analysis;Servers;Computational modeling;Resource management;Optimization;Wireless communication;Learning (artificial intelligence)","cellular radio;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;manufacturing systems;Markov processes;mobile computing;nonlinear programming;optimisation","migration schemes optimization;mobility-aware MEC network;intelligent edge computing;edge devices;intelligent analysis;data analysis;mobile equipments;offloaded tasks;migration incurs additional costs;joint task offloading;mobility-aware Mobile Edge Computing network;maximum system revenue;joint optimization problems;total revenue;mobility-aware MEs;time-varying computation tasks;mixed integer nonlinear programming problem;reinforcement learning-based optimization framework","","33","","","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To generalize to unseen netlists, we use a mixture of handcrafted features from graph topology theory and graph embeddings generated using unsupervised graph neural networks. Our RL algorithms are chosen to overcome the sparsity of data and latency of placement runs. As a result, our trained RL agent achieves up to 11% and 2.5% wire length improvements on unseen netlists compared with a human engineer and a state-of-the-art tool auto-tuner in just one placement iteration ( $20\times $  and  $50\times $  fewer iterations).

Inspired by classical EDAs, PMBGNP memorizes the current best individuals and uses them to estimate a distribution for the generation of the new population. However, PMBGNP can evolve compact programs by representing its solutions as graph structures. Therefore, it can solve a range of problems different from conventional ones in EDA literature, such as data mining and Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This paper extends PMBGNP from discrete to continuous search space, which is named PMBGNP-AC. Besides evolving the node connections to determine the optimal graph structures using conventional PMBGNP, Gaussian distribution is used for the distribution of continuous variables of nodes. The mean value Î¼ and standard deviation Ï are constructed like those of classical continuous Population-based incremental learning (PBILc). However, a RL technique, i.e., Actor-Critic (AC), is designed to update the parameters (Î¼ and Ï). AC allows us to calculate the Temporal-Difference (TD) error to evaluate whether the selection of the continuous value is better or worse than expected. This scalar reinforcement signal can decide whether the tendency to select this continuous value should be strengthened or weakened, allowing us to determine the shape of the probability density functions of the Gaussian distribution. The proposed algorithm is applied to a RL problem, i.e., autonomous robot control, where the robot's wheel speeds and sensor values are continuous. The experimental results show the superiority of PMBGNP-AC comparing with the conventional algorithms.","1941-0026","978-1-4673-1509-8","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256481","","","Gaussian distribution;genetic algorithms;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;search problems","continuous estimation;evolving graph structures;reinforcement learning;graph-based estimation of distribution algorithm;graph-based EDA;probabilistic model building genetic network programming;continuous search space;PMBGNP-AC;optimal graph structure determination;Gaussian distribution;node connections;continuous variables distribution;standard deviation;mean value;continuous population-based incremental learning;PBILc;RL technique;actor-critic technique;temporal difference error;TD error;continuous value selection;scalar reinforcement signal;probability density functions;autonomous robot control;wheel speeds;sensor values","","3","","27","IEEE","2 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It adopts a directed graph structure to represent a solution to a given problem. Agents judge situations and execute actions sequentially following the node transitions in the graph. On one hand, GNP possesses an advantage of node reusability, which makes it possible to realize a compact graph structure that represents a solution. On the other hand, the compact structure suggests that any connection might play a significant role in the solution, i.e., a slight change to the connections could tremendously influence the performance of the agents for the given task. The conventional GNP, however, lacks an effective way to evaluate and to take advantage of the connections. This paper thus proposes a reinforcement learning approach to learn GNP's subgraphs that contain a relatively small number of connections, and further proposes a partial reconstruction approach to modify the solution with the obtained subgraphs. These two approaches are combined together to form a new evolutionary learning model named GNP with Evolution-oriented Reinforcement Learning (GNP-ERL).

Specifically, we model three density indicators, 1) local density to describe the vehicle density relationship around the ego vehicle, 2) lane density to describe the denseness of vehicles on each lane, 3) global density to describe the denseness of current region of interest of DM. Among them, local density and lane density are considered as input features to make the agent aware of density properties to distinguish dense scenes while global density is used as a factor of the reward function to balance the safety and efficiency. The agent learns to make full use of density information to help the current DM process through learning. We train and test the models in an environment with different density scenarios.

This type of ADS is typically limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives (e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the merging vehicle's optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem, we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow conditions.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317735","Autonomous Driving;Highway On-Ramp Merge;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Long Short-Term Memory;Deep Q-Network;Control Policy","Merging;Computer architecture;Machine learning;Acceleration;Learning (artificial intelligence);Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;road traffic control;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","deep reinforcement learning architecture;driving systems;ADS;freeway-pilot functions;restricted-access freeways;automated modes;ramp merging process;automation;automated vehicle;long-term objectives;near-term actions;vehicles whose behaviors;merging vehicle;complicated control problem;optimal driving policy;long-term reward;interactive environment;Long Short-Term Memory architecture;internal state;historical driving information;Deep Q-Network;DQN;action selection;DRL architecture;optimal control policy;autonomous driving scenarios;Q-function approximation;on-ramp merge;DRL techniques;automated driving systems","","70","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithms were tested by exposing them to 105 simulated stall scenarios with different initial conditions (including altitude, bank angle and wind speed) and an acceptable stall recovery was achieved in 85.7% of the test cases. The overall recovery time increased with an increase in altitude, with the best and worst recovery times obtained at 10,000ft and 30,000ft respectively.

The PB-RDRM is composed of a bi-level optimization problem, in which the upper-level dynamic retail pricing problem aims to maximize the profit of a utility company (UC) by selecting optimal retail prices (RPs), while the lower-level demand response (DR) problem expects to minimize the comprehensive cost of loads by coordinating their energy consumption behavior. The challenges here are mainly two-fold: 1) the uncertainty of energy consumption and RPs; 2) the flexible PEVs' temporally coupled constraints, which make it impossible to directly develop a model-based optimization algorithm to solve the PB-RDRM. To address these challenges, we first model the dynamic retail pricing problem as a Markovian decision process (MDP), and then employ a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn the optimal dynamic RPs of UC according to the loads' responses. Our proposed RL-based DR algorithm is benchmarked against two model-based optimization approaches (i.e., distributed dual decomposition-based (DDB) method and distributed primal-dual interior (PDI)-based method), which require exact load and electricity price models. The comparison results show that, compared with the benchmark solutions, our proposed algorithm can not only adaptively decide the RPs through on-line learning processes, but also achieve larger social welfare within an unknown electricity market environment.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2021.1004287","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922076,61725304,61873252,61991403,61991400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583162","Demand response management (DRM);Markovian decision process (MDP);Monte Carlo simulation;reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid","Energy consumption;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Pricing;Demand response;Smart grids","demand side management;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);load dispatching;Markov processes;optimisation;pricing;smart power grids","RL-based DR algorithm;model-based optimization approaches;distributed primal-dual interior;electricity price models;on-line learning processes;smart grids;reinforcement learning-based approach;PB-RDRM;dispatchable loads;plug-in electric vehicles;bi-level optimization problem;upper-level dynamic retail pricing problem;optimal retail prices;lower-level demand response problem;energy consumption behavior;model-based optimization algorithm;model-free reinforcement learning algorithm;price-based residential demand response management","","27","","38","","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While several methods have attempted to interpret vision-based RL, most come without detailed explanation for the agentâs behavior. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised interpretable framework, which can discover interpretable features to enable easy understanding of RL agents even for non-experts. Specifically, a self-supervised interpretable network (SSINet) is employed to produce fine-grained attention masks for highlighting task-relevant information, which constitutes most evidence for the agentâs decisions. We verify and evaluate our method on several Atari 2600 games as well as Duckietown, which is a challenging self-driving car simulator environment. The results show that our method renders empirical evidences about how the agent makes decisions and why the agent performs well or badly, especially when transferred to novel scenes. Overall, our method provides valuable insight into the internal decision-making process of vision-based RL. In addition, our method does not use any external labelled data, and thus demonstrates the possibility to learn high-quality mask through a self-supervised manner, which may shed light on new paradigms for label-free vision learning such as self-supervised segmentation and detection.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3037898","National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100701,2018YFB1702903); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906106,61936009,62022048); Institute for Guo Qiang of Tsinghua University; Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259236","Deep reinforcement learning;interpretability;attention map;decision-making process","Task analysis;Decision making;Perturbation methods;Reinforcement learning;Jacobian matrices;Visualization;Games","","","Algorithms;Learning;Reinforcement, Psychology","3","","67","IEEE","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

RL algorithms can therefore be applied to a wide range of systems. This paper explores the use of a custom environment to optimize a problem pertinent to process engineers. In this study the custom environment is a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The purpose of using a custom environment is to illustrate that any number of systems can readily become RL environments. Three RL algorithms are investigated: deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin-delayed DDPG (TD3), and proximal policy optimization. They are evaluated based on how they converge to a stable solution and how well they dynamically optimize the economics of the CSTR. All three algorithms perform 98% as well as a first principles model, coupled with a non-linear solver, but only TD3 demonstrates convergence to a stable solution. While itself limited in scope, this paper seeks to further open the door to a coupling between powerful RL algorithms and process systems engineering.","2378-5861","978-1-5386-8266-1","10.23919/ACC45564.2020.9147706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147706","","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Inductors;Chemical reactors;Steady-state;Modeling;Heating systems","chemical reactors;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;production engineering computing","dynamic economic optimization;continuously stirred tank reactor;reinforcement learning algorithms;output information;RL environments;proximal policy optimization;goal-oriented machine learning algorithm;CSTR;deep deterministic policy gradient;twin-delayed DDPG;TD3","","4","","18","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network-based heuristic rules are introduced into the action space, and a novel state definition that integrates local and global information about the scheduling problem is proposed. Group training and group validating strategies are adopted to test the generalization ability.

However, crowdshipping requires to adapt to real-time changes such as road conditions and customer demands, which heuristic algorithms are not suitable for addressing these issues. Therefore, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to react to real-time environmental changes to solve the CVRP. The CVRP considers a single depot and multiple transfer points to serve multiple customers, in which cargos can be delivered by either the vehicle directly, or crowdworkers after the vehicle stores cargos at transfer points. In the proposed DRL, the agent explores feasible decisions, and revises the path that it should take based on feedbacks. The cost effectiveness that affects crowdshipping includes the vehicle routing, and whether the concerned customer is suitable for crowdshipping. The experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of the trained model for medium-sized VRPs are much higher than classical heuristic algorithms.","","978-1-6654-8687-3","10.1109/IEEM55944.2022.9989773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989773","Vehicle routing problem;crowdsourcing;machine learning","Crowdsourcing;Deep learning;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Roads;Vehicle routing;Transportation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);goods distribution;logistics;optimisation;production engineering computing;reinforcement learning;search problems;transportation;vehicle routing;vehicles","carbon emissions;classical heuristic algorithms;concerned customer;cost effectiveness;crowdshipping vehicle routing problem;crowdshipping VRP;crowdsourcing logistics;customer demands;CVRP;deep reinforcement learning approach;DRL;multiple customers;multiple transfer points;real-time changes;real-time environmental changes;road conditions;single depot;transportation costs;vehicle stores cargos","","","","12","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing related methods either suffer from inefficient training or mainly focus on isolated intersections. This article aims at the cooperative control for multi-intersection traffic signal, in which a novel end-to-end learning model is established and an efficient training method is proposed analogously, which is capable of adapting to large-scale scenarios. In the proposed method, the input traffic status in multi-intersection are expressed by a tensor without information loss, which significantly reduces model complexity than using a huge matrix, since additional convolutional layers can be required to extract features from a huge matrix. For the output, a multidimensional boolean vector is employed to simplify the control policy with abiding the practical phase changing rules, and then a multi-task learning structure is used to get the cooperative policy. Instead of only using the reinforcement learning to train the model, we employ imitation learning to integrate a rule based model to do the pre-training, which greatly accelerates the convergence. Afterwards, the reinforcement learning method is adopted to continue the fine training, where proximal policy optimization algorithm is incorporated to solve the policy collapse problem in multi-dimensional output situation.

Due to the unknown environment and complicated constructions, it is difficult to build an accurate dynamical model. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered as a new means of solving complex and unpredictable control problems in recent years compared with traditional control methods. This is because RL algorithm is independent on the system model, and the controller parameters can be optimized by the iteration of the algorithm itself. In this paper, three model-free RL methods including Deep Q Network (DQN), Policy-Gradient (PG) and Deep Deterministic Policy (DDPG) are used to design the controller of the 2-DOF flight attitude simulator, and the performances of the methods are analyzed respectively. The results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show good robustness in the control system. Moreover, the contribution of the RL method to the control field is pointed out and the problems that still need to be solved are listed at the end of this paper.","","978-1-7281-0513-0","10.1109/IMCEC46724.2019.8983893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983893","reinforcement learning;Deep Q Network;PolicyGradient;Deep Deterministic Policy;aircraft control","","aerospace simulation;aircraft control;attitude control;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","RL algorithm;system model;controller parameters;model-free RL methods;RL method;control field;flight attitude simulator control system design;model-free reinforcement learning;two-degree-of-freedom flight attitude simulator;experimental platform;control theory research;accurate dynamical model;reinforcement learning;complex control problems;unpredictable control problems;deep deterministic policy;deep Q network;policy-gradient;2-DOF flight attitude simulator","","","","7","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Heuristic search is used by the most part orientation methods to select the optimal orientation from a large solution space. Search algorithms occasionally converge towards the local optimum and waste considerable time on trial and error. This issue could be addressed if there was an intelligent agent that knew the optimal search path for a given 3D model. A straightforward method to construct such an agent is reinforcement learning (RL). By adopting this idea, the time-consuming online searches in existing part orientation methods will be moved to the offline learning stage, potentially improving part orientation performance. This is a challenging problem because the goal is to build an agent capable of rotating arbitrary 3D models, whereas RL agents frequently struggle to generalize in new scenarios. Therefore, this paper suggests a generalizable reinforcement learning (GRL) framework to train the agent, and a GRL benchmark to support the training, testing, and comparison of part orientation approaches. Experimental results de- monstrate that the proposed method on average outperforms others in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. It is proved to have the potential to solve the local minima problems raised in the existing approaches, to swiftly discover the global (sub-)optimal solution (i.e., on average 2.62Ã to 229.00Ã faster than the random search algorithm), and to generalize beyond the environment in which it was trained.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2023.3249751","EPSRC UKRI Innovation Fellowship(grant numbers:EP/S001328/1); EPSRC New Investigator(grant numbers:EP/S000453/1); EPSRC Future Advanced Metrology Hub(grant numbers:EP/P006930/1); EPSRC Fellowship in Manufacturing(grant numbers:EP/R024162/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054468","Additive manufacturing (AM);build orientation determination;generalizable reinforcement learning (GRL);support volume","Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Task analysis;Search problems;Reinforcement learning;Training;Intelligent agents;Three-dimensional printing","","","","","","41","IEEE","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The learnt policy, for filling and confirming information slots, was derived from COMMUNICATOR (flight-booking) data using reinforcement learning (RL) as described in [2], ported to the tourist information domain (using a general method that we propose here), and tested using 18 human users in 180 dialogues, who also used a state-of-the-art hand- coded dialogue policy embedded in an otherwise identical system. We found that users of the (ported) learned policy had an average gain in perceived task completion of 14.2% (from 67.6% to 81.8% at p < .03), that the hand-coded policy dialogues had on average 3.3 more system turns (p < .01), and that the user satisfaction results were comparable, even though the policy was learned for a different domain. Combining these in a dialogue reward score, we found a 14.4% increase for the learnt policy (a 23.8% relative increase, p < .03). These results are important because they show a) that results for real users are consistent with results for automatic evaluation [2] of learned policies using simulated users [3, 4], b) that a policy learned using linear function approximation over a very large policy space [2] is effective for real users, and c) that policies learned using data for one domain can be used successfully in other domains. We also present a qualitative discussion of the learnt policy.","","1-4244-0872-5","10.1109/SLT.2006.326774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123391","","Filling;Learning;System testing;Function approximation;Graphical user interfaces;Informatics;Project management;Management information systems;Humans;Natural languages","function approximation;information systems;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;travel industry","reinforcement learned dialogue strategies;Talk Towninfo evaluation;learnt dialogue management policy;hand-coded policy;Townlnfo tourist information system;linear function approximation","","28","2","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose the context-aware safe reinforcement learning (CASRL) method, a metal-earning framework to realize safe adaptation in non-stationary environments. We use a probabilistic latent variable model to achieve fast inference of the posterior environment transition distribution given the context data. Safety constraints are then evaluated with uncertainty-aware trajectory sampling. Prior safety constraints are formulated with domain knowledge to improve safety during exploration. The algorithm is evaluated in realistic safety-critical environments with non-stationary disturbances.
