Moreover, it is non-trivial to provide a kinematic independent general solution. In this study, we developed a cyclic three-phase optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning for human-robot motion retargeting. The motion retargeting learning is performed using refined data in a latent space by the cyclic and filtering paths of our method. In addition, the human- in-the-loop based three-phase approach provides a framework for the improvement of the motion retargeting policy by both quantitative and qualitative manners.

However, a lot of robotic manipulation tasks are trajectory-centric, and thus do not require a global model or policy. Due to inaccuracies in the learned model estimates, an open-loop trajectory optimization process mostly results in very poor performance when used on the real system.

IPP means an Imitation learning method fusing visual information with the additional steering angle calculated by Pure-Pursuit (PP) method, and RL means using Reinforcement Learning for further training. In our IPP model, the visual information captured by camera can be compensated by the calculated steering angle, thus it could perform well under bad weather conditions. However, imitation learning performance is limited by the driving data severely. Thus we use a reinforcement learning method-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-in the second stage training, which shares the learned weights from pretrained IPP model. In this way, our IPP-RL can lower the dependency of imitation learning on demonstration data and solve the problem of low exploration efficiency caused by randomly initialized weights in reinforcement learning. Moreover, we design a more reasonable reward function and use the n-step return to update the critic-network in DDPG.

In a weakly supervised manner, we propose a Spatial Transform AutoEncoder (STAE) to learn an interpretable and controllable representation in which different parts correspond to different object attributes (shape, color, position). Due to the high controllability of the representations, STAE can simply recombine and recode the representations to generate unseen goals for agents to practice themselves. The manifold structure of the learned representation maintains consistency with the physical position, which is beneficial for reward calculation.

However, a core challenge in this paradigm lies in collecting large amounts of meaningful data, while not depending on a human in the loop for data collection. One way to address this challenge is through task-agnostic exploration, where an agent attempts to explore without a task-specific reward function, and collect data that can be useful for any subsequent task. While these approaches have shown some promise in simple domains, they often struggle to explore the relevant regions of the state space in more challenging settings, such as vision-based robotic manipulation. This challenge stems from an objective that encourages exploring everything in a potentially vast state space. To mitigate this challenge, we propose to focus exploration on the important parts of the state space using weak human supervision. Concretely, we propose an exploration technique, Batch Exploration with Examples (BEE), that explores relevant regions of the state-space, guided by a modest number of human-provided images of important states. These human-provided images only need to be provided once at the beginning of data collection and can be acquired in a matter of minutes, allowing us to scalably collect diverse datasets, which can then be combined with any batch RL algorithm. We find that BEE¬†is able to tackle challenging vision-based manipulation tasks both in simulation and on a real Franka Emika Panda robot, and observe that compared to task-agnostic and weakly-supervised exploration techniques, it (1) interacts more than twice as often with relevant objects, and (2) improves subsequent task performance when used in conjunction with offline RL.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3068655","Schmidt Futures; ONR(grant numbers:N00014-20-1-2675); NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385945","Deep learning methods;reinforcement learning","Deep learning;Reinforcement learning;Data collection","","","","4","","51","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reinforcement learning (RL) can potentially find effective control policies, but training RL using physical soft robots is often infeasible, and training using simulations has had a high barrier to adoption. To accelerate research in control and RL for soft robotic systems, we introduce SoMoGym (Soft Motion Gym), a software toolkit that facilitates training and evaluating controllers for continuum robots. SoMoGym provides a set of benchmark tasks in which soft robots interact with various objects and environments. It allows evaluation of performance on these tasks for controllers of interest, and enables the use of RL to generate new controllers. Custom environments and robots can likewise be added easily.

This letter presents an algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) to attack this challenging problem. Considering the complexity of living object grasping, we divide the whole task into pre-grasp and in-hand stages and let the algorithm switch between the stages automatically. The pre-grasp stage is aimed at finding a good pose of a robot hand approaching a living object for performing a grasp. Dense reward functions are proposed for facilitating the learning of right hand actions based on the poses of both hand and object. Since an object held in hand may struggle to escape, the robot hand needs to adjust its configuration and respond correctly to the object's movement. Hence, the goal of the in-hand stage is to determine an appropriate adjustment of finger configuration in order for the robot hand to keep holding the object. At this stage, we treat the robot hand as a graph and use the graph convolutional network (GCN) to determine the hand action. We test our algorithm with both simulation and real experiments, which show its good performance in living object grasping.

In safe RL, we aim to find a policy which maximizes the desired return while satisfying the defined safety constraints. There are various types of constraints, among which constraints on conditional value at risk (CVaR) effectively lower the probability of failures caused by high costs since CVaR is a conditional expectation obtained above a certain percentile. In this paper, we propose a trust region-based safe RL method with CVaR constraints, called TRC. We first derive the upper bound on CVaR and then approximate the upper bound in a differentiable form in a trust region. Using this approximation, a subproblem to get policy gradients is formulated, and policies are trained by iteratively solving the subproblem. TRC is evaluated through safe navigation tasks in simulations with various robots and a sim-to-real environment with a Jackal robot from Clearpath.

To obtain policies that are perceived as safe, we propose a shield synthesis framework with two distinct loops: (1) an inner loop that trains policies with a set of actions that is constrained by shields whose conservativeness is parameterized, and (2) an outer loop that presents example rollouts of the policy to humans and collects their feedback to update the parameters of the shields in the inner loop. We demonstrate our approach on a RL benchmark of Lunar landing and a scenario in which a mobile robot navigates around humans. For the latter, we conducted two user studies to obtain policies that were perceived as safe. Our results indicate that our framework converges to policies that are perceived as safe, is robust against noisy feedback, and can query feedback for multiple policies at the same time.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3128237","Vinnova Competence Center for Trustworthy Edge Computing Systems and Applications; Kungliga Tekniska H√∂gskolan; Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems, and Software Program; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616473","Safety in HRI;human factors and human-in-the-loop;reinforcement learning","Safety;Robots;Reinforcement learning;Task analysis;Noise measurement;Feedback loop;Training","feedback;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;path planning","trains policies;distinct loops;shield synthesis framework;adversarial behavior;agent;formal verification;safe policies;deep reinforcement learning;perceived safety;feedback shield synthesis;multiple policies;noisy feedback;RL benchmark;inner loop;shields;outer loop","","3","","26","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However multi-agent systems with complex structures (curse of dimensionality) or with high constraints (like bio-inspired (a) snake or serpentine robots) show limited performance in such environments due to sparse-reward nature of environment and no fully observable model representation. In this paper we present a constructive learning and planning scheme that reduces the complexity of high-diemensional agent model by decomposing it into identical, connected and scaled down multiagent structure and then apply learning framework in layers of local and global ranking. Our layered hierarchy method also decomposes the final goal into multiple sub-tasks and a global task (final goal) that is bias-induced function of local sub-tasks. Local layer deals with learning `reusable' local policy for a local agent to achieve a sub-task optimally; that local policy can also be reused by other identical local agents. Furthermore, global layer learns a policy to apply right combination of local policies that are parameterized over entire connected structure of local agents to achieve the global task by collaborative construction of local agents. After learning local policies and while learning global policy, the framework generates sub-tasks for each local agent, and accepts local agents' intrinsic rewards as positive bias towards maximum global reward based of optimal sub-tasks assignments. The advantage of proposed approach includes better exploration due to decomposition of dimensions, and reusability of learning paradigm over extended dimension spaces. We apply the constructive policy method to serpentine robot with hyper-redundant degrees of freedom (DOF), for achieving optimal control and we also outline connection to hierarchical apprenticeship learning methods which can be seen as layered learning framework for complex control tasks.","2161-8089","978-1-7281-0356-3","10.1109/COASE.2019.8843223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843223","","Robots;Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Multi-agent systems;Biological system modeling;Reinforcement learning;Computational modeling","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","reinforcement learning approach;connected multiagent systems;policy based reinforcement learning methods;fully observable model representation;constructive learning;planning scheme;high-diemensional agent model;constructive policy method;hierarchical apprenticeship learning methods;layered learning framework;complex control tasks","","3","","43","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obtained RL controllers are shown to generate two flight modes, spin and tic-toc. We analyse the properties of these flight modes and screen out unfavourable RL controllers.

The weights are then treated as design parameters dependent on the expertise (and preference) of the person performing the learning, with the typical result that a new solution is required for any change in these settings. This paper investigates the relationship between the reward function and the optimal value function for MORL; specifically addressing the question of how to approximate the optimal value function well beyond the set of weights for which the optimization problem was actually solved, thereby avoiding the need to recompute for any particular choice. We prove that the value function transforms smoothly given a transformation of weights of the reward function (and thus a smooth interpolation in the policy space). A Gaussian process is used to obtain a smooth interpolation over the reward function weights of the optimal value function for three well-known examples: Gridworld, Objectworld and Pendulum. The results show that the interpolation can provide robust values for sample states and actions in both discrete and continuous domain problems. Significant advantages arise from utilizing this interpolation technique in the domain of autonomous vehicles: easy, instant adaptation of user preferences while driving and true randomization of obstacle vehicle behavior preferences during training.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197456","","Interpolation;Training;Learning (artificial intelligence);Gaussian processes;Mathematical model;Random variables;Optimization","Gaussian processes;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","smooth interpolation;reward function weights;optimal value function;multiobjective reinforcement learning problems;Gaussian process;value function transforms;MORL problems","","1","","20","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our approach, we meta-train the OLR-CAM policy within a ‚Äú2D Navigation Meta World System‚Äù.

The robot's aim is to autonomously perform earth scooping cycles with three degrees of freedom: lift, tilt and the robot's velocity. While the majority of previous studies on automated scooping processes are based on data recorded by expert operators, we present a method to autonomously control a wheel loader to perform the scooping cycle using deep reinforcement learning methods without any user-provided demonstrations. The controller's learning approach is based on the actorcritic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm which we use to map online sensor data as input to continuously update the actuator commands. The training of the scooping policy network is done solely in a simplified simulation environment using a virtual physics engine, which converges to an average of a 65% fill factor from the full bucket capacity and a 5 [sec] average cycle time. We illustrate the performance of the trained policy in simulations and in real-world experiments with 3 different inclination angles of the earth. An additional scooping experiment compared the performance of our controller to remote manual human control. Overall, the deep reinforcement learning-based controller exhibited good performance in terms of both achieved visually bucket fill with varying scooped earth weights of 4.1 - 7.2[kg], and a 5.1 - 7.1[sec] cycle time. The experimental results confirm the ability of our planner to fill bucket as required, indicating that our controller can be used for excavation purposes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056625","Israeli Ministry of Defense through Project ROBIL(grant numbers:87726311); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344588","Robotics in construction;machine learning;agricultural automation","Wheels;Trajectory;Robots;Reinforcement learning;Earth;Task analysis;Soil","excavators;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles","scooping cycle;deep reinforcement learning methods;learning approach;deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm;scooping policy network;average cycle time;trained policy;remote manual human control;scooped earth weights;wheel loader scooping controller;unmanned ground vehicle;automated scooping processes;deep reinforcement learning-based controller","","23","","27","CCBY","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the complexity of MEC systems grows exponentially with the number of MDs or edge servers (ES), so learning a good offloading policy is a huge challenge when the number of MDs or ESs is large. Moreover, MDs are often unable to find optimal ESs for offloading since the restricted ESs infrastructures and the spatiotemporally imbalanced task offloading requirements. To solve these problems, we propose a Curriculum Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (CSTMAAC)-based task offloading method. Each ES is regarded as an agent and the problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization task. To adapt to the large-scale MEC systems, we first introduce an evolutionary curriculum learning by gradually raising the number of trained ES agents in a phased way. Second, to facilitate the coordination of the offloading policies among geographically distributed ESs, we design an attention-based centralized critic-network. Besides, a delayed access mechanism is introduced that uses information about future task processing competition to capture the impact of potential future task processing contention and help ES agents obtain a better offloading strategy. Finally, critic-network is expanded to multi-critics and a dynamic weight mechanism is designed to adaptively optimize multi-objectives and obtain a good balance for multiple objectives. Real-world datasets used in experiments demonstrate that CSTMAAC raises task completion rates and total utility by 13.01% 15.21% and 16.89% 18.32% compared with the existing algorithms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3292387","Research, development and application of internet service platform for the whole industry chain collaboration in packaged food industry(grant numbers:2021YFF0901205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173664","Multi-access edge computing (MEC);task offloading;resource allocation;reinforcement learning;curriculum learning","Task analysis;Resource management;Training;Optimization;Internet of Things;Collaboration;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","5 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The goal is to improve the process of teaching the robotic arm to perform a full-scan of the surface of free-formed components during an automatic quality inspection. As today‚Äôs standard approach, the teaching of a robotic arm to follow a complicated trajectory is being done manually by experts. However, this approach is not always reliable and might not necessarily result in an optimal trajectory. As a consequence, a lot of time and effort by a human expert is required. In addition, when a new component with a modified design has to be inspected, the human expert must create a suitable inspection trajectory for this component and meanwhile the whole process of automatic inspection has to be stopped for a considerably long time. The latter forms the biggest motivation of the presented work. The main focus of this work is to examine whether the teaching task can be accelerated by employing reinforcement learning methodologies to use the available information about the shape of the component to control the robot‚Äôs tool center point (TCP). As an initial step, a simulation environment has been developed, in which the position and orientation of the robot‚Äôs TCP can be controlled. During the simulation episodes a randomly generated 2D trajectory appears on the panel in front of the robot, and while observing the points on the trajectory, the robot trained with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm follows the trajectory, and its goal is to reach the end point, while minimizing the time and the deviation from the trajectory.

These tasks may take a long time to complete or even be thrown away. Since the unknown information of both the ESs and other MDs, it is difficult for each MD to determine its offloading policy independently. Furthermore, most offloading methods have poor generalization to new environment since they focus on model architecture with a fixed quantity of MDs and ESs, preventing trained models from transferring to other environments. In the paper, we provide a full decentralized offloading scheme based on the Curriculum Attention-weighted Graph Recurrent Network-based Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (CAGR-MAAC). First, we build MEC as a shared MD agents-ESs graph and an AGR-based message network is designed to enable each MD aggregate the information of ESs and other MDs and solve the partial observability of MD agents for MEC system. Second, a learnable differentiable encoder network is introduced to construct MD agent‚Äôs local information encoding. Subsequently, the MD agent converts overall the information regarding the MEC system into a fixed-size embedding via an AGR Network to handle different quantity of MDs and ESs. Finally, we introduce curriculum learning to address the huge complexity of the MEC system and the training difficulties induced by the large amounts of MDs and ESs. Experiments demonstrate that compared with existing algorithms, CAGR-MAAC boosts task completion rates and decreases system costs by 13.01% 15.03% and 16.45% 18.56%, and can quickly adapt to the new environment.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3285950","Research, development and application of internet service platform for packaged food industry for the whole industry chain synergy(grant numbers:2021YFF0901205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10153416","Multi-access edge computing (MEC);task offloading;resources allocation;multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL);recurrent graph neural networks (R-GNNs)","Task analysis;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Internet of Things;Complexity theory;Training;Observability","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Further, utilities can perform load shifting by price-based demand-response programs. However, the scheduling problem is challenging in the presence of multiple unknown variables, such as real-time prices, commuting behavior, and energy needs. Most of the scheduling techniques attempt to model the system uncertainties (e.g., forecast prices) and plan accordingly. In this paper, we propose the use of a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique that can deduce a charging/discharging strategy without requiring any model of the system.

The primary focus of the current deep learning-based models is to learn the discriminative representations in the foreground over motion and appearance in small-term temporal segments. In the video segmentation process, it is difficult to handle various challenges such as deformation, scale variation, motion blur, and occlusion. Furthermore, relocating the segmentation target in the next frame is difficult if it is lost in the current frame during the segmentation process. This work aims at solving the zero-shot video object segmentation issue in a holistic fashion. We take advantage of the inherent correlations between the video frames by incorporating a global co-attention mechanism to overcome the limitations. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides competent and fast stages for gathering scene context and global correlations. The agent concurrently calculates and adds the responses of co-attention in the joint feature space. To capture the different aspects of the common feature space, the agent can generate multiple co-attention versions. Our framework is trained using pairs (or groups) of video frames, which adds to the training content, thus increasing the learning capacity. Our approach encodes the important information during the segmentation phase by a simultaneous process of various reference frames that are subsequently utilized to predict the persistent and conspicuous objects in the foreground. The proposed method has been validated using four commonly used video entity segmentation datasets: SegTrack V2, DAVIS 2016, CdNet 2014, and the Youtube-Object dataset. On the DAVIS 2016, the results reveal that the proposed results boost the state-of-the-art techniques on the F1 Measure by 4%, SegTrack V2 by a Jaccard Index of 12.03%, and Youtube Object by a Jaccard Index of 13.11%.

Specifically, dynamic provisioning of resources is needed to handle varying passenger loads that are subject to increased uncertainties due to the pandemic. Classical optimization methods could be computationally expensive; and rule-based heuristics that are well-tuned for normal operating conditions could be sub-optimal during periods of rapid change. We complement existing works with a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach for dynamic provisioning of airport resources. Specifically, we consider the problem of jointly provisioning immigration and medical screening resources for inbound passenger flow. Our approach uses a state representation that encodes the supply and demand of the provisioned resources; and a reward engineered to capture the resource cost vs passenger delay trade-off. As baselines, we use two heuristics that statically and dynamically provision resources. We evaluate our approach on a simulated airport environment calibrated with real-world data. In scenarios that statistically significantly differ from the learning dataset, RL achieves up to ~20X decrease in passenger delay when compared to the heuristics for up to ~1.6X increase in resource cost.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922383","","Costs;Supply and demand;Uncertainty;Pandemics;Optimization methods;Reinforcement learning;Quality of service","airports;optimisation;reinforcement learning;service industries","dynamic provisioning;airport resources;inbound passenger flow;reinforcement learning;varying passenger loads;optimization methods;immigration;medical screening resources;resource cost;passenger delay trade-off;simulated airport environment","","","","24","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indonesia‚Äôs GDP is expected to grow in the coming years, and tourism is a major contributor to this growth. To address the high demand for tourism, we propose a personalized tourism route recommendation system that can assist tourists in planning their itineraries. This problem can be modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem, which can be approached using Markov Decision Processes and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we proposed a method for generating N-days tourism routes in the Special Region of Yogyakarta that involves using Q-learning to recommend routes. We have included time constraints in our approach to fit the tour into a specific time frame and adhere to the operating hours of tourist attractions. Additionally, our method uses the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to consider various attributes, such as rating, travel time, and cost, as cost functions to satisfy the user‚Äôs custom desired needs and preferences. The proposed method was compared to the Firefly algorithm in multiple experiments to assess its performance and determine its optimality. The experiment results showed that the proposed method is 42.89% more optimal for generating the tour than the Firefly algorithm.","","979-8-3503-3401-2","10.1109/I2CT57861.2023.10126347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10126347","Reinforcement learning;traveling salesman problem;route recommendation;itinerary planning","Q-learning;Costs;Economic indicators;Utility theory;Traveling salesman problems;Markov processes;Cost function","decision theory;Markov processes;recommender systems;reinforcement learning;travel industry;travelling salesman problems;utility theory","Indonesia;Markov decision processes;multiattribute utility theory;personalized tourism route recommendation system;Q-learning;reinforcement learning;specific time frame;time constraints;traveling salesman problem","","","","19","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989385","","Robots;Training;Instruction sets;Learning (artificial intelligence);Neural networks;Safety;Heuristic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators","deep reinforcement learning;robotic manipulation;asynchronous off-policy updates;autonomous robots;hand-engineered policy representations;human-supplied demonstration;sample complexity;deep Q-functions;3D manipulation skills","","653","1","42","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, finding time efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26% improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989037","","Collision avoidance;Learning (artificial intelligence);Kinematics;Decision making;Real-time systems;Navigation;Planning","collision avoidance;decentralised control;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems;robot kinematics","decentralized noncommunicating multiagent collision avoidance;deep reinforcement learning;collision-free paths;multiagent systems;online computation;interaction pattern prediction;offline learning procedure;agent joint configuration;agent positions;agent velocities;collision-free velocity vector;agent motion uncertainty;path quality improvement","","269","","26","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we use demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as stacking blocks with a robot arm.

While other distributed multi-robot collision avoidance systems exist, they often require extracting agent-level features to plan a local collision-free action, which can be computationally prohibitive and not robust. More importantly, in practice the performance of these methods are much lower than their centralized counterparts. We present a decentralized sensor-level collision avoidance policy for multi-robot systems, which directly maps raw sensor measurements to an agent's steering commands in terms of movement velocity. As a first step toward reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized methods, we present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to learn an optimal policy. The policy is trained over a large number of robots on rich, complex environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement learning algorithm. We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance policy in a variety of simulated scenarios with thorough performance evaluations and show that the final learned policy is able to find time efficient, collision-free paths for a large-scale robot system. We also demonstrate that the learned policy can be well generalized to new scenarios that do not appear in the entire training period, including navigating a heterogeneous group of robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots.

In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the robot acts in the environment, but are difficult to deploy in the real-world due to their high sample complexity.

Next, the sampling-based planners provide roadmaps which connect robot configurations that can be successfully navigated by the RL agent. The same RL agents are used to control the robot under the direction of the planning, enabling long-range navigation. We use the Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) for the sampling-based planner.

Traditional model-based reinforcement learning algorithms make a certainty equivalence assumption on their learned models and calculate optimal policies for a maximum-likelihood Markovian model. We consider algorithms that evaluate and synthesize controllers under distributions of Markovian models. Previous work has demonstrated that algorithms that maximize mean reward with respect to model uncertainty leads to safer and more robust controllers. We consider briefly other performance criterion that emphasize robustness and exploration in the search for controllers, and note the relation with experiment design and active learning.

However, model-free methods are known to perform poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this paper, we study how maximum entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for both simulated and real-world tasks.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-3081-5","10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460756","","Entropy;Robots;Learning (artificial intelligence);Neural networks;Machine learning;Task analysis;Training","control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators","composable deep reinforcement;model-free deep reinforcement learning;simulated robotic manipulation;model-free methods;real-world robotic tasks;maximum entropy policies;soft Q-learning;real-world robotic manipulation","","87","1","38","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accuracy of cutting depends on tensioning, wherein the gripper pinches a point on the gauze in R3 and pulls to induce and maintain tension in the material as cutting proceeds. An automated tensioning policy maps the current state of the gauze to output a direction of pulling as an action. The optimal tensioning policy depends on both the choice of pinch point and cutting trajectory. We explore the problem of learning a tensioning policy conditioned on specific cutting trajectories. Every timestep, we allow the gripper to react to the deformation of the gauze and progress of the cutting trajectory with a translation unit vector along an allowable set of directions. As deformation is difficult to analytically model and explicitly observe, we leverage deep reinforcement learning with direct policy search methods to learn tensioning policies using a finite-element simulator and then transfer them to a physical system. We compare the Deep RL tensioning policies with fixed and analytic (opposing the error vector with a fixed pinch point) policies on a set of 17 open and closed curved contours in simulation and 4 patterns in physical experiments with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK).

The importance of predictions that are robust to this distributional shift is evident for safety-critical applications, such as collision avoidance around pedestrians. Measures of model uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates. The methods are embedded in a Safe Reinforcement Learning framework to form uncertainty-aware navigation around pedestrians. The result is a collision avoidance policy that knows what it does not know and cautiously avoids pedestrians that exhibit unseen behavior.

Deep RL provides an end-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the need for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn to perform a variety of tasks on two different low-cost hardware platforms entirely from scratch, and further study how the learning can be accelerated by using a small number of human demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that complex multi-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about 4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3 hours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable and practical alternative to simulation and model-based control. https:// sites.google.com/view/deeprl-handmanipulation.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794102","","Task analysis;Valves;Acceleration;Reinforcement learning;Robot sensing systems;Hardware","control engineering computing;dexterous manipulators;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;robot programming","deep reinforcement learning;multifingered hands;contact-rich manipulation behavior;model-free deep RL algorithms;complex multifingered manipulation skills;direct deep RL training;model-based control;dexterous manipulation;dexterous multifingered robotic hands;general-purpose robotic manipulators;autonomous control;complex intermittent contact interactions","","60","","30","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing model-based RL methods learn in relatively few samples, but typically take too much time between each action for practical on-line learning. In this paper, we present a novel parallel architecture for model-based RL that runs in real-time by 1) taking advantage of sample-based approximate planning methods and 2) parallelizing the acting, model learning, and planning processes in a novel way such that the acting process is sufficiently fast for typical robot control cycles.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive thermal management approach to improve the lifetime reliability of multicore systems by considering both inter- and intra-application thermal variations. Fundamental to this approach is a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns the relationship between the mapping of threads to cores, the frequency of a core and its temperature (sampled from on-board thermal sensors). Action is provided by overriding the operating system's mapping decisions using affinity masks and dynamically changing CPU frequency using in-kernel governors. Lifetime improvement is achieved by controlling not only the peak and average temperatures but also thermal cycling, which is an emerging wear-out concern in modern systems. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using an Intel quad-core platform executing a diverse set of multimedia benchmarks. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach minimizes average temperature, peak temperature and thermal cycling, improving the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by an average of 2√ó for intra-application and 3√ó for inter-application scenarios when compared to existing thermal management techniques.

The continuum arm is pneumatically actuated and attains a spatial work-space by a combination of unidirectional bending and bidirectional torsional deformation. We use Deep-Q Learning with experience replay to train the system in simulation. The efficacy and robustness of the control policy obtained from the system is validated both in simulation and on the continuum arm prototype for varying external loading conditions.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793653","","Manipulators;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Strain","bending;control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;neural nets;numerical analysis;pneumatic actuators;position control;torsion","open loop position control;deep reinforcement learning;soft robots;nonlinear spatial deformations;inherent actuation;numerical models;soft spatial continuum arm;unidirectional bending deformation;bidirectional torsional deformation;Deep-Q Learning;continuum arm prototype;external loading conditions","","42","","34","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A known problem, though, is that policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare, catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was developed, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward), except through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on a self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to model risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that a risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and experiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an adversary.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of replacing expensive lidar devices with affordable depth cameras which have a limited FOV. First, we analyze the effect of a limited field of view in the DRL agents. Second, we propose a LSTM agent with Local-Map Critic (LSTM-LMC), which is a novel DRL method to learn efficient navigation in a complex environment with a limited FOV. Lastly, we introduce the dynamics randomization technique to improve the robustness of the DRL agents in the real world. We found that our method with a limited FOV can outperform the methods having a wide FOV but limited memory.

In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework of the HEV power management with the aim of improving fuel economy. The DRL technique is comprised of an offline deep neural network construction phase and an online deep Q-learning phase. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning, DRL presents the capability of handling the high dimensional state and action space in the actual decision-making process, making it suitable for the HEV power management problem. Enabled by the DRL technique, the derived HEV power management policy is close to optimal, fully model-free, and independent of a prior knowledge of driving cycles.

For this, we model the task with rewards and train a deep Q-network. Our potential field-based heuristic exploration strategy reduces the amount of collisions which lead to suboptimal outcomes and we actively balance the training set to avoid bias towards poor examples. Our training process leads to quicker learning and better performance on the task as compared to uniform exploration and standard experience replay.

The major contribution of this paper is making use of deep learning in the form of neural networks with stochastic DDP, and showing the advantages of neural networks over LWR. For this purpose, we extend neural networks for: (1) modeling prediction error and output noise, (2) computing an output probability distribution for a given input distribution, and (3) computing gradients of output expectation with respect to an input. Since neural networks have nonlinear activation functions, these extensions were not easy. We provide an analytic solution for these extensions using some simplifying assumptions.

While previous studies have investigated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for NPP control, none of them have addressed making the relatively complicated power-increase operation fully autonomous. This study focused on developing an algorithm for converting all the currently manual activities in the NPP power-increase process to autonomous operations. An asynchronous advantage actor-critic, which is a type of deep reinforcement learning method, and a long short-term memory network were applied to the operator tasks for which establishing clear rules or logic was challenging, while a rule-based system was developed for those actions, which could be described by simple logic (such as if-then logic). The proposed autonomous power-increase control algorithm was trained and validated using a compact nuclear simulator (CNS). The simulation results were used to evaluate the algorithm‚Äôs ability to control the parameters within allowable limits, and the proposed power-increase control algorithm was proven capable of identifying an acceptable operation path for increasing the reactor power from 2% to 100% at a specified rate of power increase.

We adopt a Bayesian approach where a posterior distribution over the model parameters is maintained and updated through experience with the environment. We propose a particle filter algorithm to maintain the posterior distribution and an online planning algorithm, based on trajectory sampling, to plan the best action to perform under the current posterior.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) holds the promise to address these issues by fully exploiting the robot dynamics with minimal craftsmanship. In this paper, we propose a novel DRL approach that enables an agent to learn omnidirectional locomotion for humanoid (bipedal) robots. Notably, the locomotion behaviors are accomplished by a single control policy (a single neural network). We achieve this by introducing a new curriculum learning method that gradually increases the task difficulty by scheduling target velocities. In addition, our method does not require reference motions which facilities its application to robots with different kinematics, and reduces the overall complexity.

In order to improve the energy-efficiency for the overall multicore system, we propose an online DVFS control strategy based on core-level Modular Reinforcement Learning (MRL) to adaptively select appropriate operating frequencies for each individual core. Instead of focusing solely on the local core conditions, MRL is able to make comprehensive decisions by considering the running-states of multiple cores without incurring exponential memory cost which is necessary in traditional Monolithic Reinforcement Learning (RL).

We would expect a social robot, which plans its motions among humans, to consider both the social acceptability of its behavior as well as task constraints, such as time limits. These requirements are often contradictory and therefore resulting in a trade-off. For example, a robot has to decide whether it is more important to quickly achieve its goal or to comply with social conventions, such as the proximity to humans, i.e., the robot has to react adaptively to task-specific priorities. In this paper, we present a method for priority-adaptive navigation of mobile autonomous systems, which optimizes the social acceptability of the behavior while meeting task constraints. We learn acceptability-dependent behavioral models from human demonstrations by using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). These models are generative and describe the learned stochastic behavior. We choose the optimum behavioral model by maximizing the social acceptability under constraints on expected time-limits and reliabilities.

In order to address the limitations of both teleoperation and fully autonomous robotic control for urban search and rescue (USAR) environments, semi-autonomous controllers can be developed to allow task sharing and cooperation between a human operator and a robot.

As technology continues to scale, transistors and wires on the chip are becoming increasingly vulnerable to various fault mechanisms, especially timing errors, resulting in exacerbation of energy efficiency and performance for NoCs. Typical techniques for handling timing errors are reactive in nature, responding to the faults after their occurrence. They rely on error detection/correction techniques which have resulted in excessive power consumption and degraded performance, since the error detection/correction hardware is constantly enabled. On the other hand, indiscriminately disabling error handling hardware can induce more errors and intrusive retransmission traffic. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the trade-offs among error rate, packet retransmission, performance, and energy. In this paper, we propose a proactive fault-tolerant mechanism to optimize energy efficiency and performance with reinforcement learning (RL). First, we propose a new proactive error handling technique comprised of a dynamic scheme for enabling per-router error detection/correction hardware and an effective retransmission mechanism. Second, we propose the use of RL to train the dynamic control policy with the goals of providing increased fault-tolerance, reduced power consumption and improved performance as compared to conventional techniques. Our evaluation indicates that, on average, end-to-end packet latency is lowered by 55%, energy efficiency is improved by 64%, and retransmission caused by faults is reduced by 48% over the reactive error correction techniques.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-2-3","10.23919/DATE.2019.8714869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714869","","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Error correction codes;Hardware;Decoding;Reinforcement learning;Timing","electronic engineering computing;energy conservation;error correction;error detection;fault tolerance;integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);network-on-chip","fault-tolerant network-on-chip design;reinforcement learning;standard communication fabric;energy efficiency;intrusive retransmission traffic;proactive fault-tolerant mechanism;reactive error correction techniques;NoC;power consumption;indiscriminate disabling error handling hardware;per-router error detection-correction hardware techniques;proactive error rate;transistors;wires;RL;packet retransmission mechanism;dynamic control policy;end-to-end packet latency;efficiency 64 percent","","18","","18","","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While research on social navigation has focused mainly on the scalability with the number of pedestrians in open spaces, typical indoor environments present the additional challenge of constrained spaces such as corridors and doorways that limit maneuverability and influence patterns of pedestrian interaction. We present an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) to learn policies capable of dynamic adaptation to the presence of moving pedestrians while navigating between desired locations in constrained environments. The policy network receives guidance from a motion planner that provides waypoints to follow a globally planned trajectory, whereas RL handles the local interactions. We explore a compositional principle for multi-layout training and find that policies trained in a small set of geometrically simple layouts successfully generalize to more complex unseen layouts that exhibit composition of the structural elements available during training. Going beyond walls-world like domains, we show transfer of the learned policy to unseen 3D reconstructions of two real environments. These results support the applicability of the compositional principle to navigation in real-world buildings and indicate promising usage of multi-agent simulation within reconstructed environments for tasks that involve interaction. https://ai.stanford.edu/‚àºcdarpino/socialnavconstrained/","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560893","","Training;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Navigation;Scalability;Layout;Buildings","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;navigation;path planning;pedestrians;reinforcement learning;robot vision","reinforcement learning;RL;multilayout training;real-world buildings;robot navigation;constrained pedestrian environments;mobile robots;social navigation;open spaces;pedestrian interaction;multi-agent simulation;3D reconstruction","","17","","37","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Intent-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","S. Qi; S. -C. Zhu","University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, Los Angeles","2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","13 Sep 2018","2018","","","7533","7540","This paper proposes an intent-aware multi-agent planning framework as well as a learning algorithm. Under this framework, an agent plans in the goal space to maximize the expected utility. The planning process takes the belief of other agents' intents into consideration. Instead of formulating the learning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), we propose a simple but effective linear function approximation of the utility function. It is based on the observation that for humans, other people's intents will pose an influence on our utility for a goal. The proposed framework has several major advantages: i) it is computationally feasible and guaranteed to converge. ii) It can easily integrate existing intent prediction and low-level planning algorithms. iii) It does not suffer from sparse feedbacks in the action space. We experiment our algorithm in a real-world problem that is non-episodic, and the number of agents and goals can vary over time. Our algorithm is trained in a scene in which aerial robots and humans interact, and tested in a novel scene with a different environment. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the best performance and human-like behaviors emerge during the dynamic process.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-3081-5","10.1109/ICRA.2018.8463211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8463211","","Planning;Prediction algorithms;Automata;Vehicles;History;Computational modeling","aerospace robotics;control engineering computing;decision theory;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;multi-agent systems;planning (artificial intelligence);robot dynamics","low-level planning algorithms;intent-aware multiagent reinforcement learning;learning algorithm;planning process;partially observable Markov decision process;linear function approximation;intent-aware multiagent planning;aerial robots;human interaction;dynamic process;POMDP","","17","2","42","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
